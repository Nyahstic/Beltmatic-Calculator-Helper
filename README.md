Beltmatic is a casual factory game where you combine numbers using mathematical operations.

This is a program based on the GO project that is located here:

I do not recall where or when I found it, but it is basically same with some added bonus's for the ability to select things a bit easier to use.

It is NOT perfect and far from it but it is open to those whom wish to even take a look as it may help you in your next project and play the game.

Keep in mind that I am in NO means able to reproduce the maths that are taking place as I am not a Math person but learning on how it is working.
